Program Description:

The program that reads a list of names, ages and telephone numbers 
from a text file <input file> and inserts them into a Binary Search 
Tree (BST). 

The input text file is expected to contain list in the form of:
<name> <age> <phone>.

Once the tree has been built, the program will present the user with 
a menu that allows him or her to search the list for a specified name, 
insert a new name, delete an existing name, or print the entire phone 
list in ascending order. 

The program menu has the following choices:
  1. search the list for a specified name
  2. insert a new name
  3. delete an existing name
  4. print entire phone list in ascending order
  5. print current inorder tree
  6. quit

At the end, the data in the list is written back to the file with 
file name <input file>-out.

Test input file with 10 names is included with this program (input.txt).
